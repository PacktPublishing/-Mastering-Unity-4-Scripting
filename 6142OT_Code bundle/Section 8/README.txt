This section only uses one script, but is worked on additively in the 3 videos, the script created in completion is "InventoryPrefs.cs"

Inside the script I have 3 regions setup for Video One, Video Two, and Video Three.

To test the script assign it to the camera, press play. To save your PlayerPrefs press the "S" key. To load your PlayerPrefs press the "L" key.
