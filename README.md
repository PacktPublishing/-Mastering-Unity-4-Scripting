## About the Video Course
Mastering Unity 4 Scripting will show you the ropes for all the tools you'll need to make just about any game. Whether it's 2D or 3D, a first-person shooter or puzzle game, everything you need to know, will be covered in this course.

Mastering Unity 4 Scripting will teach you everything you need to know in order to make a wide variety of games. This course covers valuable topics such as audio, animation, saving and loading data, as well as scripting behavioral artificial intelligence - all of which will be discussed in a systematic and simple series of videos.

This course begins by demonstrating how to program audio, then delves into AI scripting, and then wraps up with how to save and load data. Beginning with handling audio and sound effects, you then get into handling parallax backgrounds. After that, you will learn how to create an AI and character controller for a generic enemy. The course then wraps up by learning how to change levels and save/load data.

Mastering Unity 4 Scripting is a great course to learn all you need to get started with making your own games.
